   This is a probabilistic method.
   The numbers on which it is wrong are called Frobenius pseudoprimes (FPP).
   Have been proved:
   a) There are no FPP < 2^64.
   b) There are many other limitations on FPP.
   c) There is no known FPP at all.
   There is a hypothesis that FPP does not exist at all.
